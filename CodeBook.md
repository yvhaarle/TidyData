# Codebook

This files contains a table with all the variables, their units and a description.

Important notes:
* All variables - except "subject" and "activity" - are unitless because the data has been normalised into a range between -1 and 1.  
* All variables - except "subject" and "activity" - are averages taken for the activity and the subject (see also README.md) 


Variable name | description
--------------|------------
subject | number of the subject that performed the activity [1-30]    
activity | The activity performed (self explanatory)
tBodyAcc-mean()-X |mean of accelerometer signals in the X direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter  
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y |mean of accelerometer signals in the Y direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z |mean of accelerometer signals in the Z direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
tBodyAcc-std()-X |standard deviation of accelerometer signals in the X direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
tBodyAcc-std()-Y |standard deviation of accelerometer signals in the Y direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
tBodyAcc-std()-Z |standard deviation of accelerometer signals in the Z direction: 50 Hz time domain signals that were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
